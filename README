== GLVote Is

GLVote is a simple web application to facilitate balloting according to the
bylaws of the New Jersey Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons.  It should
be trivial to implement your own election but note that we make the following
assumptions:

* Voting booths are touch screen computers running Firefox or Chrome full screen.
* There is one or more registration desk (poll worker station).
* Voter registration is handled outside the context of this application.
* A private wired network consisting of one or more registration desk / poll
  worker stations, one or more voting booth stations, and one computer running
  the Thin web server that is assumed to be free of eavesdroppers by virtue of
  the network being physically secure.

== GLVote Is Not

GLVote is not a general purpose election application. Do not pretend it is. We
make many assumptions to keep the system simple and reliable.

GLVote takes advantage of client-side enhancements that enable real-time
functionality.  The test suite uses Firefox and we test with Chrome.  We do not
even attempt to support Internet Explorer although it very well may work just fine.

== Test Suite Quirks

The Cucumber test suite assumes the availability of a Faye server running on the
localhost on port 9393.  This can be launched with the command <tt>rackup -s thin -E production -p 9393 faye.ru</tt>.

A Guardfile is included.  To use it run: <tt>guard start</tt>.

== Production Use

We use SQLite for production but feel free to modify database.yml and use something else.
Use <tt>rake db:setup</tt> to setup your own database.  The reason we stick with SQLite
is for the simplicity and lack of need for anything high performance.

A production-ready Procfile is included.  To use it run: <tt>foreman start</tt>.

== To Do

The first thing on our to do list is to write down a to do list and post it here.
